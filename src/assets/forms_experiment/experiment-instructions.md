# Trading Game Instructions

Welcome to this trading experiment! Please read these instructions carefully. Your payment will be based on your performance in the trading game and your answers to a financial literacy quiz.

## Overview
You will trade a single stock over two rounds, with a training round at the start to help you get comfortable. Each round includes:
- 40 price updates ("trials"), each lasting 8 seconds
- Starting balance of E$500 in cash
- One unit of stock worth E$1000
- A short questionnaire after each round about your trading experience

## Trading Rules
- You can own either 0 or 1 unit of stock at any time.
- You can only buy when you don't own the stock.
- You can only sell when you own the stock.
- You can borrow money (have negative cash), but this will reduce your final payoff.
- No trading is allowed during the first three price updates of each round.

## How Stock Prices Move
The stock price updates every 8 seconds and follows two possible states:
1. Good State (like economic expansion):
   - 80% chance price goes up
   - 20% chance price goes down

2. Bad State (like recession):
   - 80% chance price goes down
   - 20% chance price goes up

When the price changes, it will move by either E$50, E$100, or E$150 (randomly chosen).

The state can change after each price update:
- 85% chance the state stays the same
- 15% chance it switches to the other state
- The initial state is randomly chosen

## Market data
You will trade on two different platforms (in random order):

1. Basic Platform:
   - Shows only price information

2. Data-Enhanced Platform:
   - Shows price information
   - Shows other traders' buying and selling activity
   - These traders include:
     * Informed traders who know the current state (they buy in good states and sell in bad states)
     * Random traders who trade without any information
   - You'll know what percentage of traders are informed, but not which trades come from which type

Before and after trading, you'll be asked how much you would pay to access the market data.

## Payment
- One round will be randomly selected for payment.
- Your earnings at the end of the experiment will be equal to the amount of cash you hold at the end of the randomly-chosen payment round plus the end-of-round price of the stock if you own it.  
- Your earnings will be converted from experimental dollars (E$) to real money at a rate of E$1 = CA$0.0025
- You will also earn CA$0.10 for each correct answer in the financial literacy quiz
- You will receive a fixed payment of CA$15 per hour in addition to your performance-based earnings

## Important Notes
- Watch the market carefully to try to identify whether the stock is in a good or bad state
- Your trading screen will show the current stock price, your cash balance, and your stock holdings
- In rounds with market data, you'll also see recent buying and selling activity
- Trading is paused briefly at certain points during a round to ask about your beliefs regarding price movements.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profits by buying when you think the price will rise and selling when you think it will fall.

## Training
Before the main rounds, you'll complete a 10-trial practice round to familiarize yourself with the trading interface.
